Program AB is the reference implementation of the AIML 2.0 draft specification. AIML is a widely adopted standard for creating chat bots and mobile virtual assistants like ALICE, Mitsuku, English Tutor, The Professor, S.U.P.E.R. and many more. Program AB was developed by Richard Wallace (contact info@alicebot.org) and first released in January, 2013. Following in the tradition of naming AIML interpreters after letters of the alphabet (Program B, Program D, Program N, Program O etc.), the name "AB" is intended to suggest a fresh start with AIML 2.0. Program AB is an experimental platform for the development of new features and serves as the reference implementation.

You can use Program AB in a variety of ways:

* Run Program AB to chat with a bot.
* Analyze log files and develop bot content.
* Link Program AB as a library to your Java application to add a chatbot feature.
* Add code for application-specific custom AIML tags.
* Customize and build Program AB for your own needs.
